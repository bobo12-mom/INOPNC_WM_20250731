# Site Assignment Issue - Investigation and Fix Summary

## Issue Description
User reported seeing "현재 배정 된 현장이 없습니다" (No currently assigned site) message despite believing there should be site assignments in the database.

## Investigation Results

### 1. Database Status ✅
**Finding**: The database is correctly configured with proper site assignments.

- **User Profile Exists**: manager@inopnc.com user exists in profiles table
  - ID: 950db250-82e4-4c9d-bf4d-75df7244764c
  - Role: site_manager
  - Status: active
  
- **Site Assignment Exists**: Manager has an active assignment to "강남 A현장"
  - Site ID: 55386936-56b0-465e-bcc2-8313db735ca9
  - Active: true
  - Assigned Date: 2025-08-17
  - Role: site_manager

- **Total Sites in Database**: 20 sites available
- **RLS Policies**: Working correctly, allowing authenticated users to view their assignments

### 2. Authentication Flow Issue 🔧
**Finding**: The auto-login feature was not properly propagating the session to server-side actions.

#### Root Cause
The auto-login in the client component (`home-tab.tsx`) was signing in successfully but the session wasn't immediately available to server-side actions due to:
1. Cookie propagation delay between client and server
2. Insufficient wait time after authentication for session establishment
3. Missing session verification before attempting to fetch site data

#### Console Evidence
```
✅ [AUTO-LOGIN] Auto-login successful: manager@inopnc.com
❌ [HOME-TAB] Session refresh failed: Auth session missing!
❌ [HOME-TAB] User not authenticated, clearing site info
```

## Fix Applied

### 1. Improved Session Propagation Handling
Modified `components/dashboard/tabs/home-tab.tsx`:

```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: Wait for session to be fully established
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  console.log('🔄 [AUTO-LOGIN] Waiting for session to propagate...')
  
  // First, ensure the session is stored properly
  await supabase.auth.getSession()
  
  // Then wait a bit for cookie propagation
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
  
  // Now verify the session is accessible
  const { data: { session: verifySession } } = await supabase.auth.getSession()
  
  if (verifySession?.access_token) {
    console.log('✅ [AUTO-LOGIN] Session verified and ready')
    // Reset attempt counter on success
    setAutoLoginAttempts(0)
    // Now fetch site data with the established session
    fetchSiteData()
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Session Refresh Logic
Added proper wait time after session refresh:

```typescript
if (refreshResult?.session) {
  console.log('✅ [HOME-TAB] Session refreshed successfully')
  // Wait for the refreshed session to propagate
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500))
  // Retry with the new session
  return fetchSiteData(retryCount + 1)
}
```

## Testing Scripts Created

### 1. Database Check Script
`scripts/check-manager-database.js` - Verifies:
- User profile existence
- Site assignments
- Auth user status
- RLS policy effects

### 2. Auth Flow Test Script
`scripts/test-auth-flow.js` - Tests:
- Sign in process
- Session persistence
- Site assignment queries
- Session refresh mechanism

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Database Status**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/check-manager-database.js
   ```

2. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-auth-flow.js
   ```

3. **Manual Testing**:
   - Clear browser cache and localStorage
   - Navigate to dashboard
   - Auto-login should trigger for manager@inopnc.com
   - Site information should display "강남 A현장"

## Key Learnings

1. **Session Propagation Timing**: Supabase sessions need time to propagate from client to server cookies
2. **Verification Before Use**: Always verify session accessibility before making authenticated requests
3. **Retry Logic**: Implement proper retry mechanisms with delays for session-related operations
4. **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging helps identify session state issues

## Debug Controls Available

The app includes debug controls (visible in development mode) for:
- Checking session state
- Refreshing session
- Clearing auto-login state
- Enabling/disabling auto-login
- Force sign out

Access these via the debug panel in the bottom-right corner of the dashboard.

## Recommendations

1. **Production Deployment**: Remove or disable auto-login for production
2. **Session Management**: Consider implementing a session manager service
3. **Error Recovery**: Add user-friendly error messages and recovery options
4. **Monitoring**: Add session health monitoring to catch issues early

## Files Modified

- `/components/dashboard/tabs/home-tab.tsx` - Fixed auto-login session propagation
- Created `/scripts/check-manager-database.js` - Database verification script
- Created `/scripts/test-auth-flow.js` - Authentication flow test script
- Created `/docs/site-assignment-fix-summary.md` - This documentation

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The issue has been resolved. The auto-login now properly waits for session establishment before attempting to fetch site data, ensuring that the manager@inopnc.com user can see their assigned site ("강남 A현장") correctly.
