## Conclusion

The INOPNC Work Management System has a solid foundation with 40% of features implemented. The remaining 60% requires focused development over 12 weeks, with the daily report system being the most critical priority. Following this phased approach ensures systematic completion while maintaining quality and meeting all PRD requirements.

The key to success will be:
1. Maintaining focus on the daily report system first
2. Ensuring proper testing at each phase
3. Getting regular user feedback
4. Managing technical debt proactively
5. Keeping security and performance as primary concerns

With proper resource allocation and adherence to this plan, the system can be fully operational within the 12-week timeline.
