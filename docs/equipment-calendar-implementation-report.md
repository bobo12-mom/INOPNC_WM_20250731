# Equipment Availability Calendar Implementation Report

## Date: 2025-08-02

## Overview
The Equipment Availability Calendar has been successfully implemented as part of the Equipment & Resource Management module. This calendar provides a visual representation of equipment availability, checkout schedules, and maintenance periods.

## Components Created

### 1. Equipment Calendar Component (`/components/equipment/equipment-calendar.tsx`)

**Features:**
- **Monthly Calendar View**: Displays a full month calendar with Korean day names
- **Equipment Filtering**: Dropdown to filter by specific equipment or view all
- **Event Types**: 
  - Checkouts (blue) - Shows when equipment is checked out
  - Maintenance (amber) - Shows scheduled and ongoing maintenance
  - Available (green) - Shows available periods
- **Navigation**: Previous/Next month buttons and "Today" button
- **Interactive Days**: Click on any day to see detailed events
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop with touch mode support

**Key Functionality:**
```typescript
interface CalendarEvent {
  id: string
  type: 'checkout' | 'maintenance' | 'available'
  title: string
  equipment: Equipment
  startDate: string
  endDate: string
  data?: EquipmentCheckout | EquipmentMaintenance
}
```

### 2. Calendar Integration

**Equipment Management Update** (`/components/equipment/equipment-management.tsx`):
- Added new "ÏùºÏ†ï Ï∫òÎ¶∞Îçî" (Schedule Calendar) tab
- Integrated with existing equipment management system
- Maintains consistent UI/UX with other tabs

## Data Integration

### API Calls
1. **Equipment List**: Fetches all equipment for filtering dropdown
2. **Checkouts**: Retrieves equipment checkouts for the selected month
3. **Maintenance**: Gets maintenance records for the selected month

### Data Processing
- Events are processed from both checkout and maintenance records
- Date ranges are calculated to show multi-day events
- Events are filtered based on selected equipment and date range

## UI/UX Features

### Calendar Grid
- 7-day week grid with Sunday-Saturday layout
- Sunday dates in red, Saturday in blue, weekdays in gray
- Today's date highlighted with a ring
- Selected date has a gray background
- Days with events show event count badge

### Event Display
- Up to 3 events shown per day cell
- Additional events indicated with "+N more"
- Color-coded event types with icons:
  - üì¶ Blue for checkouts
  - üîß Amber for maintenance
  - ‚úÖ Green for available

### Selected Date Details
- Clicking a date shows detailed event information
- Full event details including:
  - Equipment name and code
  - Event type and status
  - User/site information (for checkouts)
  - Maintenance type and description
  - Dates and durations
  - Costs (for maintenance)

## Touch Mode Support

- **Glove Mode**: Larger touch targets for construction site use
- **Precision Mode**: Compact layout for detailed work
- **Normal Mode**: Standard desktop/mobile layout
- All buttons and interactive elements adapt to touch mode

## Font Size Adaptation

- Uses `getFullTypographyClass` for consistent font sizing
- Supports large font mode for better readability
- All text elements scale appropriately

## Performance Considerations

1. **Efficient Data Loading**: 
   - Loads only current month data
   - Parallel API calls for equipment, checkouts, and maintenance
   
2. **Client-Side Filtering**:
   - Equipment filtering happens instantly without server calls
   - Date selection and event display are immediate

3. **Loading States**:
   - Shows loading spinner during data fetch
   - Prevents UI flicker or empty states

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation support for calendar
- Clear visual indicators for different states
- High contrast colors for event types
- Screen reader friendly labels

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Functional Testing**:
   - Create equipment checkouts spanning multiple days
   - Schedule maintenance for various equipment
   - Test month navigation and year boundaries
   - Verify equipment filtering works correctly

2. **UI Testing**:
   - Test all touch modes (glove/precision/normal)
   - Verify font size scaling
   - Check responsive layout on mobile devices
   - Test dark mode compatibility

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty calendar (no events)
   - Many events on single day
   - Events spanning month boundaries
   - Concurrent checkouts and maintenance

## Access Instructions

1. Navigate to Dashboard ‚Üí Ïû•ÎπÑ & ÏûêÏõê Í¥ÄÎ¶¨ (Equipment & Resource Management)
2. Click on "ÏùºÏ†ï Ï∫òÎ¶∞Îçî" (Schedule Calendar) tab
3. Use the equipment dropdown to filter by specific equipment
4. Navigate months using arrow buttons
5. Click on any date to see detailed events for that day

## Future Enhancements

1. **Week/Day Views**: Add alternative calendar views
2. **Event Creation**: Allow creating checkouts/maintenance directly from calendar
3. **Conflict Detection**: Highlight scheduling conflicts
4. **Export Feature**: Export calendar to standard formats (iCal, PDF)
5. **Recurring Events**: Support for recurring maintenance schedules
6. **Resource Planning**: Show equipment utilization rates

## Conclusion

The Equipment Availability Calendar successfully provides a visual overview of equipment schedules, helping managers plan resource allocation and avoid conflicts. The implementation follows the project's design patterns and integrates seamlessly with the existing equipment management system.
