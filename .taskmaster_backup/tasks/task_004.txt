# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Analytics Dashboard Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build comprehensive analytics dashboard backend with data aggregation and API endpoints
# Details:
Design analytics database schema for metrics storage. Create Supabase functions for data aggregation: daily report completion rates, material usage trends, attendance patterns, equipment utilization, site productivity metrics. Implement time-series data storage for historical analysis. Create REST API endpoints for dashboard data. Set up real-time data streaming for live metrics. Implement data retention policies. Create role-based access for analytics (site managers see their sites, admins see all).

# Test Strategy:
Test data aggregation accuracy with known datasets. Verify API performance with large data volumes. Test real-time updates with concurrent users. Validate role-based data filtering. Monitor query performance and optimize indexes. Test data retention and archival processes.
