# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Critical Authentication and Security Tests (Phase 1)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Achieve 100% test coverage for authentication flows, middleware, and protected route access control to ensure application security foundation
# Details:
1. Test `/lib/supabase/server.ts` cookie handling:
   ```typescript
   describe('Supabase Server Client', () => {
     it('handles cookie operations with try-catch blocks', async () => {
       const mockCookieStore = createMockCookieStore();
       // Test cookie get/set/remove operations
       // Verify error handling doesn't break auth flow
     });
   });
   ```

2. Test middleware authentication (`/middleware.ts`):
   - Test unauthenticated request redirects
   - Test session refresh logic
   - Test protected route patterns
   - Test public route access

3. Test server actions in `/app/auth/actions.ts`:
   - Test login with valid/invalid credentials
   - Test signup with validation
   - Test password reset flow
   - Verify all actions return {success, error} objects
   - Ensure no redirect() calls in server actions

4. Test auth hooks and utilities:
   - useAuth() hook behavior
   - Session persistence
   - Token refresh handling
   - Role-based access control

5. Test protected route components:
   - Verify redirect behavior for unauthenticated users
   - Test role-based component rendering
   - Test loading states during auth checks

# Test Strategy:
1. Use createMockSupabaseClient() for all auth tests
2. Test both success and failure paths for each auth operation
3. Verify security headers and CORS configuration
4. Test rate limiting and brute force protection
5. Measure coverage using jest --coverage for auth modules
6. Target: 100% statement, branch, and function coverage for auth code
