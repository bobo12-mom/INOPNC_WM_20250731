# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Performance Monitoring System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up comprehensive application performance monitoring and alerting infrastructure
# Details:
Integrate Sentry or similar APM for error tracking and performance monitoring. Implement custom performance metrics: page load times, API response times, database query performance. Set up real user monitoring (RUM) for actual user experience data. Create performance budgets and alerts. Implement server-side monitoring for Supabase functions. Track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS). Set up automated performance regression testing. Create performance dashboard for operations team.

# Test Strategy:
Verify error tracking captures all exceptions. Test performance metrics accuracy against manual measurements. Validate alert thresholds trigger appropriately. Test RUM data collection across devices. Verify no performance impact from monitoring itself. Test dashboard data accuracy and real-time updates.
