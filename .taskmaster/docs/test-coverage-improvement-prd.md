# Test Coverage Improvement Plan PRD

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive test coverage improvement plan for the INOPNC Work Management System. The current test coverage is at 6%, and our goal is to systematically increase it to 80% through targeted testing efforts.

## Current State Analysis
- Overall Coverage: 6.08% (822/13,517 statements)
- Critical Issues:
  - `app/actions`: 0% coverage (authentication and business logic)
  - `app/actions/admin`: 0% coverage (admin operations)
  - API endpoints: Very low coverage
  - Many failing tests due to mock configuration issues

## Goals
1. Achieve 80% overall test coverage
2. 100% coverage for critical authentication flows
3. 90% coverage for API endpoints
4. Establish sustainable testing practices

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Authentication and Security (Target: 20% coverage)
- Test all authentication flows in `/lib/supabase/` and `/app/auth/`
- Cover middleware authentication checks
- Test protected route access control
- Implement proper Supabase mocking utilities
- Priority: CRITICAL - These are the foundation of application security

### Phase 2: Core API Endpoints Testing (Target: 40% coverage)
- Test all CRUD operations for main entities:
  - `/api/markup-documents` - Document management API
  - `/api/sites` - Site management endpoints
  - `/api/health` - Health check endpoint
- Implement comprehensive request/response validation tests
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Add integration tests for database operations

### Phase 3: Business Logic and Actions (Target: 60% coverage)
- Test all server actions in `/app/actions/`:
  - Daily report operations
  - Attendance management
  - Document operations
  - Notification system
- Test complex business rules and calculations
- Cover data validation and transformation logic
- Test transaction handling and rollback scenarios

### Phase 4: Component Testing (Target: 70% coverage)
- Test critical UI components:
  - Markup editor and canvas components
  - Dashboard components
  - Form components with validation
  - Data display components
- Implement component interaction tests
- Test responsive behavior and accessibility
- Cover error states and loading states

### Phase 5: Integration and E2E Testing (Target: 80% coverage)
- Implement full user journey tests:
  - Login → Create Report → Submit
  - Document upload and markup flow
  - Attendance tracking workflow
- Test cross-component interactions
- Verify data persistence and retrieval
- Test real-world scenarios and edge cases

## Technical Requirements

### Testing Infrastructure
1. Fix and enhance test setup:
   - Proper Supabase mock configuration
   - Consistent test data factories
   - Reliable async operation handling
   - Test isolation and cleanup

2. Testing utilities needed:
   - `createMockSupabaseClient()` - Fully configured mock
   - `createAuthenticatedUser()` - Test user setup
   - `renderWithProviders()` - Component wrapper
   - `waitForLoadingToFinish()` - Async helper

### Testing Standards
1. Unit Tests:
   - All functions must have corresponding tests
   - Edge cases and error scenarios covered
   - Mocks should be realistic and maintainable

2. Integration Tests:
   - API endpoints tested with various payloads
   - Database operations verified
   - Authentication and authorization tested

3. E2E Tests:
   - Critical user paths covered
   - Cross-browser compatibility verified
   - Performance benchmarks established

### Success Metrics
- Coverage increases measured weekly
- No regression in existing functionality
- All new code includes tests (TDD approach)
- CI/CD pipeline remains stable

## Resource Requirements
- Estimated effort: 4-6 weeks
- Testing frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright
- Additional tools: MSW for API mocking, jest-dom for assertions

## Risk Mitigation
- Incremental approach to avoid breaking changes
- Maintain separate test database
- Regular backups before major test changes
- Parallel test execution for performance

## Deliverables per Phase
1. Phase 1: Auth test suite, mock utilities, 20% coverage
2. Phase 2: API test suite, integration tests, 40% coverage
3. Phase 3: Business logic tests, 60% coverage
4. Phase 4: Component test library, 70% coverage
5. Phase 5: E2E test suite, 80% coverage, testing documentation
