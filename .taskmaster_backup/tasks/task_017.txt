# Task ID: 17
# Title: Component Testing for New Features
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive tests for components affected by recent changes including attendance tab with labor hours, unified documents tab with card layout, and PWA-enabled components
# Details:
Implement component tests for:

1. Attendance Tab with Labor Hours:
```typescript
// __tests__/components/dashboard/tabs/attendance-tab.test.tsx
- Test labor hours display in calendar (1.0 공수 format)
- Test color coding: green (1.0+), yellow (0.5-0.9), orange (0.1-0.4)
- Test PDF payslip generation with correct calculations
- Test labor hours to work hours conversion (1.0 공수 = 8 hours)
```

2. Unified Documents Tab:
```typescript
// __tests__/components/dashboard/tabs/documents-tab.test.tsx
- Test card-based UI rendering
- Test file type badges with correct colors
- Test personal/shared document filtering
- Test document actions (download, delete, share)
```

3. PWA Components:
- Test install prompt component
- Test offline indicator
- Test push notification permission request

# Test Strategy:
Use React Testing Library for component testing. Mock Supabase calls with test utilities. Test user interactions and state changes. Verify accessibility with testing-library queries. Test responsive behavior for mobile/desktop views. Validate PDF generation triggers and downloads correctly.
