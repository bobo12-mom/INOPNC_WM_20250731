# Worker Assignment System Test Report

## Test Date: 2025-08-02

## Overview
The Worker Assignment System with skill-based wages has been successfully implemented and tested. This system allows managers to assign workers to construction sites based on their skills and calculate wages including regular and overtime rates.

## Components Tested

### 1. Database Layer
✅ **Worker Skills Table** (`worker_skills`)
- Successfully stores skill definitions with categories
- 12 default skills inserted (일반 건설, 철근 작업, 콘크리트 작업, etc.)
- Proper indexing and RLS policies applied

✅ **Worker Skill Assignments** (`worker_skill_assignments`)
- Links workers to their skills with proficiency levels
- Stores hourly and overtime rates per skill
- Supports certification tracking
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate assignments

✅ **Resource Allocations** (`resource_allocations`)
- Tracks worker assignments to sites with dates and times
- Calculates regular hours, overtime hours, and total cost
- Supports task descriptions and status tracking

### 2. UI Components

#### Resource Allocation Dashboard (`/components/equipment/resource-allocation.tsx`)
**Features:**
- Overview stats showing total workers, hours, daily costs
- Three tabs: Daily Allocations, Worker Management, Skills Management
- Real-time filtering by date and site
- Touch-optimized UI with glove/precision mode support

#### Worker Assignment Dialog (`/components/equipment/worker-assignment-dialog.tsx`)
**Features:**
- Site selection with worker's current assignments displayed
- Skill-based wage selection
- Date and time picker with automatic hours calculation
- Overtime detection and calculation (>8 hours)
- Task description field
- Real-time cost calculation display

#### Skill Management Dialog (`/components/equipment/skill-management-dialog.tsx`)
**Features:**
- View worker's current skills
- Add new skill assignments with proficiency levels
- Set hourly and overtime rates per skill
- Certification tracking with dates
- Edit existing skill assignments

### 3. Server Actions (`/app/actions/equipment.ts`)
✅ **getWorkerSkills()** - Fetches all available skills
✅ **getWorkerSkillAssignments()** - Retrieves skill assignments for workers
✅ **upsertWorkerSkillAssignment()** - Creates/updates skill assignments
✅ **getResourceAllocations()** - Fetches worker allocations with filtering
✅ **createResourceAllocation()** - Creates new worker assignments

### 4. Cost Calculation Logic

**Regular Hours Calculation:**
```typescript
const regularHours = Math.min(hoursWorked, 8)
const regularCost = regularHours * hourlyRate
```

**Overtime Calculation:**
```typescript
const overtimeHours = Math.max(0, hoursWorked - 8)
const overtimeCost = overtimeHours * (overtimeRate || hourlyRate * 1.5)
```

**Total Cost:**
```typescript
const totalCost = regularCost + overtimeCost
```

## Test Results

### Functional Tests
1. ✅ **Skill Creation**: Successfully created worker skill assignments
2. ✅ **Worker Assignment**: Created resource allocation with correct cost calculation
3. ✅ **Overtime Calculation**: Properly calculated overtime rates (1.5x regular rate)
4. ✅ **Data Persistence**: All data correctly saved to database
5. ✅ **RLS Policies**: Security policies working correctly
   - Workers can view their own assignments
   - Managers can view and manage all assignments

### UI/UX Tests
1. ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
2. ✅ **Touch Mode Support**: Buttons and inputs adapt to glove/precision modes
3. ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Cost calculations update immediately
4. ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper validation and error messages
5. ✅ **Loading States**: Appropriate loading indicators

### Performance Tests
1. ✅ **Data Loading**: Efficient parallel data fetching
2. ✅ **Search/Filter**: Fast client-side filtering
3. ✅ **Database Queries**: Optimized with proper indexes

## Sample Test Data

### Worker Assignment Created:
- **Worker**: Test Worker
- **Site**: Site 1
- **Date**: 2025-08-02
- **Hours**: 8 regular + 1 overtime = 9 total
- **Hourly Rate**: ₩25,000
- **Overtime Rate**: ₩37,500
- **Total Cost**: ₩237,500

### Skill Assignment Created:
- **Worker**: Test Worker
- **Skill**: 일반 건설 (General Construction)
- **Proficiency**: Intermediate
- **Hourly Rate**: ₩25,000
- **Overtime Rate**: ₩37,500

## Access Instructions

To access the Worker Assignment System:

1. **Login** as a manager or admin account
2. **Navigate** to Dashboard → 장비 & 자원 관리 (Equipment & Resource Management)
3. **Click** on the "자원 배치" (Resource Allocation) tab
4. **Features available**:
   - View daily worker allocations
   - Assign workers to sites
   - Manage worker skills and wage rates
   - Track daily labor costs

## Known Issues

1. **Minor**: Foreign key relationship warning in resource_allocations query (doesn't affect functionality)
2. **UI**: Skill filter in worker list could benefit from multi-select capability

## Recommendations

1. **Enhancement**: Add bulk assignment feature for multiple workers
2. **Feature**: Export functionality for payroll integration
3. **UI**: Add calendar view for better visualization of assignments
4. **Report**: Weekly/monthly cost summary reports

## Conclusion

The Worker Assignment System is fully functional and ready for production use. All core features have been implemented and tested successfully. The system provides a comprehensive solution for managing construction worker assignments with skill-based wage calculations.
