# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Automated Deployment Pipeline
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment to production
# Details:
Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline. Implement automated testing on PR: unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests with Playwright. Add code quality checks: ESLint, TypeScript, bundle size analysis. Create staging environment for pre-production testing. Implement blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates. Set up automated database migrations with rollback capability. Configure deployment notifications to Slack/Discord. Implement feature flags for gradual rollouts. Create deployment documentation and runbooks.

# Test Strategy:
Test full deployment pipeline with dummy changes. Verify rollback procedures work correctly. Test database migration scenarios including failures. Validate zero-downtime deployment with active users. Test feature flag activation/deactivation. Monitor deployment metrics and success rates. Verify all team members can trigger deployments safely.
