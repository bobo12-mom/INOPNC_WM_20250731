## Conclusion

The INOPNC Work Management System has a solid foundation with authentication, basic dashboard, and database schema in place. However, significant work remains to implement the comprehensive daily report system and other critical features outlined in the PRD.

The proposed 12-week phased approach prioritizes the most critical features (daily reports) while ensuring a systematic build-out of all required functionality. With proper resource allocation and adherence to the development standards, the system can be completed successfully within the proposed timeline.
