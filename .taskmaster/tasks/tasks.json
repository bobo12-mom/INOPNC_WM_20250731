            "details": "After implementing all test cases, execute comprehensive test runs to validate coverage and fix any issues:\n\n1. **Initial Test Execution**:\n   - Run unit tests: `npm test`\n   - Run integration tests: `npm test -- --testPathPattern=integration`\n   - Run E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`\n   - Generate coverage report: `npm test -- --coverage`\n\n2. **Coverage Analysis**:\n   - Review coverage report to identify uncovered code paths\n   - Focus on critical business logic with <70% coverage\n   - Add missing tests for authentication, payment calculations, and data operations\n   - Ensure all error handling paths are tested\n\n3. **Fix Failing Tests**:\n   - Debug and fix any failing unit tests\n   - Resolve integration test issues with database connections\n   - Fix E2E test flakiness and timing issues\n   - Update snapshots if UI changes are intentional\n\n4. **Performance Optimization**:\n   - Optimize slow-running tests (target <10s for unit test suite)\n   - Parallelize test execution where possible\n   - Use test.skip for temporarily broken features\n   - Implement test caching for faster CI runs\n\n5. **Final Validation**:\n   - Achieve 70%+ overall coverage\n   - 90%+ coverage for critical paths (auth, payments)\n   - 80%+ coverage for UI components\n   - 85%+ coverage for business logic\n   - 95%+ coverage for utilities\n\n6. **Documentation**:\n   - Create test execution guide in docs/TESTING.md\n   - Document how to run specific test suites\n   - Add troubleshooting guide for common test failures\n   - Include coverage badge in README.md",
